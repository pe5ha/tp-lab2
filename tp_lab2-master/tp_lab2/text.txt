I am writing to you — what is more?
What else can I say?
Now, I know, in your will
To punish me with contempt.
But you, to my unfortunate lot
Keeping at least a drop of pity,
You won't leave me.
At first I wanted to be silent;
Believe me: my shame
You would never know,
When would I have had hope
At least rarely, at least once a week
In our village to see you,
Just to hear your speeches,
Say a word to you, and then
All thinking, thinking about one thing
And day and night until we meet again.
But, they say, you are unsociable;
In the wilderness, in the village, everything is boring for you,
And we... we don't shine with anything,
even though we are innocently glad to see you.

Why did you visit us?
In the wilderness of a forgotten village
I would never have known you,
I wouldn't know bitter torment.
Souls of inexperienced excitement
Resigned with time (who knows?),
According to my heart, I would find a friend,
There would be a faithful spouse
And a virtuous mother.

The other one!.. No, no one in the world
I wouldn't give my heart!
That in the highest is destined to be the council…
It is the will of heaven: I am yours;
My whole life has been a pledge
Goodbye faithful with you;
I know you were sent to me by God,
To the grave you are my guardian…
You appeared to me in my dreams,
Invisible, you were so sweet to me,
Your wonderful look tormented me,
Your voice was heard in my soul
A long time ago... no, it wasn't a dream!
You just walked in, I instantly recognized,
All stunned, flamed up
And in my mind I said: here he is!
Isn't it true? I heard you:
You spoke to me in silence,
When I helped the poor
Or did she delight you with prayer
The anguish of a troubled soul?
And at this very moment
Isn't it you, dear vision,
In the transparent darkness flashed,
Clung quietly to the headboard?
Not you, with joy and love,
Did you whisper words of hope to me?
Who are you, my guardian angel,
Or an insidious tempter:
Resolve my doubts.
Maybe it's all empty,
Deception of an inexperienced soul!
And it is destined to be completely different…
But so be it! My fate
From now on, I'm handing you,
There are tears in front of you,
Your protection, I beg…
Imagine: I'm here alone,
No one understands me,
my mind is exhausted,
And I have to die in silence.
I'm waiting for you: with one eye
Revive the hopes of the heart
Or a heavy dream break,
Alas, a well-deserved reproach!

Cumming! It's scary to reread…
I freeze with shame and fear…
But I'm on bail Your Honor,
And I boldly entrust myself to her…
